  <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />
  His house is in the village though;<br />
  He will not see me stopping here<br />
  To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
  
  <p>My little horse must think it queer<br >
  To stop without a farmhouse near<br />
  Between the woods and frozen lake<br />
  The darkest evening of the year.</p>
  
  <p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br />
  To ask if there is some mistake.<br />
  The only other sound's the sweep<br />
  Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
  
  <p>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep.<br />
  But I have promises to keep,<br />
  And miles to go before I sleep,<br />
  And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
